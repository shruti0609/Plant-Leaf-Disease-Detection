# Plant-Leaf-Disease-Detection
Plant diseases detection uses machine perception equipment to obtain images to decide whether there are diseases and pests in the gathered plant images. For machine perception-based plant diseases and pests detection techniques, manual design or conventional image processing algorithms of features and classifiers are commonly used. This method uses different characteristics of plant diseases to choose an appropriate light source, design the imaging scheme and shooting angle, etc. To resolve all these challenges we can use some techniques such as Traditional image recognition processing for identification and classification. The aim of using this technique is to identify a plant disease by doing the following stages i.e Image Acquisition, Image Processing, Features Extraction and Identification, and classification.
